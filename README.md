# Celestial Body Classification and Sorting Tool

This repository contains a C program designed to classify and sort celestial bodies based on their mass and radius. This tool employs various sorting algorithms and uses dynamic programming to classify celestial bodies according to specified constraints.

## About the Program

The provided C program, [daa mini project code.c](daa%20mini%20project%20code.c), is designed to achieve the following tasks:

1. Accepts details of celestial bodies including their names, masses, and radii.
2. Sorts celestial bodies based on mass and radius using three different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
3. Classifies celestial bodies based on mass and radius constraints using a knapsack-like approach.

## Instructions to Run the Program

### Running on Ubuntu (Using GCC)

1. Open a terminal on your Ubuntu system.

2. Ensure that you have the GCC compiler installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install gcc
   ```

3. Navigate to the directory containing the `daa mini project code.c` program file using the `cd` command.

4. Compile the program using GCC:
   ```
   gcc daa\ mini\ project\ code.c -o celestial_tool
   ```

5. Run the compiled program using:
   ```
   ./celestial_tool
   ```

### Running on Online Compilers

1. Copy the code from the `daa mini project code.c` program file.

2. Visit an online C compiler such as [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler), [Ideone](https://ideone.com/), or [Replit](https://replit.com/~).

3. Paste the copied code into the online compiler's code editor.

4. Click on the "Run" or "Execute" button provided by the online compiler.
